This includes writing ISAPI code that even USES managed components.&nbsp; Anything that needs to load the CLR will result in poor performance of the ISAPI and worse, result in ASP.NET not functioning correctly.

ASP.NET loads the CLR when it initializes.&nbsp; During this loading it does many things to configure the CLR.&nbsp; One example is that it creates on GC thread for each processor on the system.&nbsp; It also sets up some defaults for the thread pools.&nbsp; When you write your ISAPI in managed code or include a COM Visible .NET component through COM in your code, your ISAPI loads the CLR.&nbsp; Since only one CLR can be loaded per process, ASP.NET will not create and configure the CLR and you are left with a severely crippled system.

This problem can also occur if you write an ISAPI Extension.&nbsp; Your Extension could load the CLR runtime if you hit a static file first, initialize the CLR in the ISAPI Extension by using .NET or a COM Visible .NET object and then hit your ASP.NET application after this initialization.

You can clearly see this in a multi processor machine if you create a filter that uses a Managed code COM component.&nbsp; Without your filter in place, hit an aspx page on the site and use DebugDiag to take a dump of the w3wp.exe process.&nbsp; Then analyze this dump with DebugDiag.&nbsp; You will see a GC thread initialized for each processor core installed on your server.&nbsp; On my server I have a quad proc CPU and I see 4 threads with this in the call stack: mscorwks!SVR::gc\_heap::gc\_thread_function.

Then I created a simple ISAPI filter from one of the existing Platform SDK samples and simply instantiated a COM Visible .NET component.&nbsp; I installed the ISAPI filter and re-ran my test.&nbsp; As expected, I saw only 1 thread with mscorwks!SVR::gc\_heap::gc\_thread_function.

This problem manifests itself not only with the GC threads but all the information set by the processModel (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7w2sway1.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7w2sway1.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7w2sway1.aspx</a>).&nbsp; In theory you could come up with some sort of scheme to read the machine.config file and parse and set this information, but this is untested and definitely not supported (read: you are on your own).

If you really are in need of writing Managed Code, you should investigate the Managed Pipeline in IIS 7 and use that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227673.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227673.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms227673.aspx</a>.&nbsp; There are a couple of other workarounds you could explore like out of proc components etc&#8230; but these would all create performance issues for a Filter or Extension.
