This was an interesting error that I had to hunt down.&nbsp; When specifying a proxy server in .NET like this: _WebProxy(&#8220;https://someproxyserver&#8221;)_ you will get this error.&nbsp; You will get this error for whatever scheme that you enter before the _&#8220;://&#8221;_ characters.&nbsp; For example if you use this: _WebProxy(&#8220;somescheme://someproxyserver&#8221;)_ Then you will get the error message: The ServicePointManager does not support proxies of somescheme scheme.&nbsp; The only scheme that is recognized by this class is http.

You will also get this error if you set something like this in your .config file: proxyAddress=&#8221;myproxy.somewhere.local:8080&#8243;  
You MUST list the scheme like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; proxyAddress=&#8221;http://myproxy.somewhere.local:8080&#8243;<p mce_keep="true">Discussion &#8211; Most organizations do not have an HTTPS Proxy server.&nbsp; This is not necessary because if SSL communication is required, this communication is between the endpoint server and the Client, not the Proxy and the client.&nbsp; This does not mean that SSL communication is in anyway not secure through an http Proxy.&nbsp; The SSL traffic is encrypted and tunneled through the Proxy just fine and this is no less secure than going directly to the SSL based target&nbsp; (as long as you trust your proxy).&nbsp; It is only the initial connection to the Proxy that is not over SSL.</p> <p mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</p>
