Just another quicky post:

If you need to add a custom domain to an Azure Web App you can use Powershell.&#160; Powershell does the same verification that the UI does and is just another way to accomplish setting the custom domain or domains.

Note that you donâ€™t set, nor can you change the default azurewebsites.net domain.

Here is an example.&#160; Lets say I have an azure webapp: jsandersprod.azurewebsite.net and I want to add the [www.jsanders.com](http://www.jsanders.com) and dev.jsanders.com sub domains to it.&#160; Assuming I have set this up already with my domain provider here is how I do it in powershell:

Get-AzureWebsite -Name "jsandersprod" | Set-AzureWebsite -HostNames @("dev.jsanders.com",[www.jsanders.com](http://www.jsanders.com))

That is all there is to it!
