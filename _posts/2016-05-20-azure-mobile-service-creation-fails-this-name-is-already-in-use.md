Just a quick blog on thisâ€¦

## Problem

You cannot create an Azure Mobile Service.&nbsp; You enter a unique name when creating the Mobile Service but get an error:&nbsp; &#8220;this name is already in use&#8221; and a red exclamation mark.

&nbsp;

## Reason

Mobile Services are deprecated, that is why you cannot create one. Please see this article: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/transition-of-azure-mobile-services/> 

&nbsp; 

## Solution

You must create a Mobile App instead in <https://portal.azure.com>. Here is a quick start for you to follow: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/> 

and

No the error is not intuitive and we are getting that fixed!
