These codes are hex representations of the underlying WinINet error codes.&nbsp; You can use calc to translate the code from hex to decimal and then look up that error here:

To use calc bring up the calculator by hitting the Windows key and typing calc.&nbsp; Then Alt+3 (or use the view menu) to change to programmer mode.&nbsp; Ensure the &#8216;Hex&#8217; radio button is selected and input the hex code.&nbsp; Then choose the &#8216;Dec&#8217; radio button to get the decimal version.
