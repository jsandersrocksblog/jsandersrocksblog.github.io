I was anxious to see what real memory usage would look like on my low end netbook.&nbsp; It was better than Windows 7!&nbsp; Less than 500M.&nbsp; One problem I had was the native resolution of my netbook is1024X600 and the will not load Windows Store applications&nbsp;at that resolution.&nbsp; I found a registry setting however to get higher non-native resolutions: &#8220;Display1_DownScalingSupported&#8221;.&nbsp; As with any registry change make sure you back up the registry first before making changes.&nbsp; I searched the registry and changed the value from 0 to 1 where I found it and restarted.&nbsp; Now I can get 1024X768 and 1152X864.

Let me know if this helped you!
