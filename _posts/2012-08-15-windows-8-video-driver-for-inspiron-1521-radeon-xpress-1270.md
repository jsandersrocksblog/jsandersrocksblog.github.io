I have an old (circa 2007) Dell Inspirion 1521 laptop and wanted to get a better Video driver installed for Windows 8.&nbsp; I found a Vista 64 bit driver on the Dell site that seems to work very well (compared to the generic drivers): <http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/DriverFileFormats/Product/latitude-d531?DriverId=X2T0W&FileId=2731098358&urlProductCode=False>

When you get to the installer, ONLY install the drivers.&nbsp; Do not install the catalyst stuff (it will make your CPU max out with an ati service).&nbsp; I had some errors installing but the display now supports full resolution and the graphics speed is much faster!&nbsp; I also upgraded to the latest bios available and gave the system the max memory I could for graphics (I had plenty to give because I have 4G Ram installed).

&nbsp;

Let me know if this helps you!
