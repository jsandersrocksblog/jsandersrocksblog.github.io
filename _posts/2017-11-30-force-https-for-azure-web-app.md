Sometimes you need or want to force HTTPS for Azure App Services (Azure Web App, Azure Mobile App, Azure Function App, etcâ€¦).&nbsp; In the past you could do this with a web.config change.

## Solution

You can now simply do this as follows: Go to the Custom Domains section of you app and set HTTPS Only to On (Off is the default) and Save.
