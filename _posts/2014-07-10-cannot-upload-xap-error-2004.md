Just a quicky post…

This is only ONE reason you may have gotten this error and I wanted to share this.&#160; If this does not solve your issue engage the forums or get assisted support from your developer dashboard.

I had a customer that was getting this error when uploading his xap file:&#160; error: 2004:&#160; Something’s happened, and we’re not quite sure what. We haven’t lost any of your app’s info, so try resubmitting again.

Cause:&#160; .NET Reactor version 4.8 bug

Resolution: Remove the "Inject Invalid Metadata” setting under Anti-ILDASM, or upgrade to version 4.9 of .NET Reactor (Store app only, phone not fixed)

&#160;

Let me know if this helped!&#160; If it did not hit the MSDM forums or assisted support, both available from your Developer dashboard.&#160; I will not attempt any further troubleshooting from this blog, but if you DO find a resolution that is different from this… Zap a comment and I will add it to the Blog!
