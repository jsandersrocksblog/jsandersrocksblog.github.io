I had trouble installing this update this morning.&nbsp; I found that since I had installed the Windows 7.1 SDK as well, I had to first install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1 KB2519277.&nbsp; This seemed to allow the other update work fine!

Let me know if this helped you!
