OK, I am a dummy.&nbsp; I spent 30 minutes trying to associate my account with the MSDN Blog sign in so I could author a blog.&nbsp; Since the change of the site it asks you for your screen name and password.&nbsp; Since I have my Live account associated with the Blog, I thought it wanted my Live ID information. 

READ Jeff, READ!&nbsp; Logon name is NOT the Logon name information for Live IDs ðŸ™‚
