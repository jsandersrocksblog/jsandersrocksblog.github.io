This took me a couple of minutes to find so I thought I would share this here.

I downloaded ProcMon (process monitor) and could view the help file.&nbsp; It would open but the right pane had a message: &#8220;Navigation to the webpage was canceled&#8221;&nbsp; The left pane was functional however.

I found the help file.&nbsp; This is a .CHM file stored in the directory where Procmon was installed.

To be able to use is, Right Click on the procmon.chm file and choose &#8216;Properties&#8217; from the menu.&nbsp; Then in the&nbsp;general tab, click on Unblock!&nbsp; **(You may need to run as an Administrator account to see the unblock item).**

Works fine now!

&nbsp;Let me know if you found this useful by dropping me a note please!
