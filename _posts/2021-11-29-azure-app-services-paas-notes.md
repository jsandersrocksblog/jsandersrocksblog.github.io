 

People moving from an on-premise to Cloud implementation sometimes have difficulty understanding they do not have control over the underlying platform updates to their PaaS resources.&nbsp; Azure App Services is a Platform as a Service (PaaS).&nbsp; Simply put, a PaaS service gives you a platform to host your code and the provider updates the platform whenever necessary.&nbsp; You cannot control when the underlying platform gets updated nor what gets updated.&nbsp; You rely on the provider of the platform to handle security and platform updates and trust that the platform simply will work.&nbsp; There are many advantages to a PaaS environment that I will not cover here.&nbsp; We have learning resources that cover all the basics of Azure here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/?wt.mc\_id=acom\_newtoazure\_webpage\_azuremktg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/?wt.mc_id=acom_newtoazure_webpage_azuremktg "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/?wt.mc_id=acom_newtoazure_webpage_azuremktg")

So what if you donâ€™t want someone else to manage your platform?&nbsp; Consider IaaS instead where you have more control:&nbsp; What is IaaS?

## Final Note

It may seem scary for someone to manage your Platform but it relieves you from the worry and overhead of being up to date.&nbsp; You can even use custom containers on the PaaS platform if you wish to encapsulate a certain environment as a container.&nbsp; Be sure to reach out to Microsoft if you have any other questions about this!
