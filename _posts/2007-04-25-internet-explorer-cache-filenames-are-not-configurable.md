So What?&nbsp; You may ask.&nbsp; This sometimes may be confusing to users!&nbsp; 

When you click on a file link in Internet Explorer you are presented with a dialog that has a _Save_ and _Open_ button.&nbsp; When you choose _Save_, the filename is under your control and the _Save File Dialog_ will get&nbsp;the file&nbsp;name from the Hyperlink or Content-Disposition – Filename attribute.&nbsp; This works wonderfully and presents no room for confusion.&nbsp; The _Open_ button is another story however.&nbsp; 

If the hyperlink for the file is a static filename (for example: <a href=&#8221;testsheet.xlsx&#8221;>Download it</a> ) then the _Open_ button will simply pass the Url off to the appropriate program (in this case Excel) and that particular program is responsible for opening the file.&nbsp; If the HTML header Content-Disposition: Attachment is specified however, Internet Explorer saves the file using the Internet Explorer cache.&nbsp; This cache is a temporary location and the algorithms used to create the file name are not under programmatic or user control.&nbsp; The end result is you may end up with a filename like “testsheet[1].xlsx”.&nbsp; Unfortunately this is not under you control as a developer and you must accommodate for this by educating the customer.&nbsp; 

This use of the IE cache becomes very apparent when downloading filenames that contain non ASCII characters such as the Japanese character sets.&nbsp; Frequently I have seen links that create streamed files simply use ASCII file names so that the filename does not contain totally unrecognizable characters.

So is there any solution to the _Open_ button not allowing you to have control over the filename?&nbsp; In theory you could write an ActiveX control to take over the downloading responsibilities.&nbsp; This would be some significant work however and prone to the security protection that Internet Explorer gives you.&nbsp; If streaming the file down, you could mess with the headers and attempt to suppress the Content-Disposition header, and in the case of the Office family of products this may allow you to bypass the bracketed name.&nbsp; I am not sure what sort of name you would wind up with then however, so it would still not be in your control.&nbsp; If you or your customer is concerned about the name of the file, then you probably will not want then opening the file in the temporary cache anyhow, so a little education will go a long way in resolving this issue in your own mind.
