For example:

[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/05/07/multi-container/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/05/07/multi-container/ "https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/05/07/multi-container/")



Now is here: 



<https://azure.github.io/AppService/2018/05/07/Multi-container-Linux-Web-App.html>



How do you find this?&nbsp; I could not find and advanced search for bing, but google has one:

<https://www.google.com/advanced_search>



Fill in the key words from the article or url (in this case I used Multi-container) and for the site list azure.github.io/AppService and the 2nd article was the one I wanted.&nbsp; I could have used the date time part of the URL as well but I was not sure if they were included in the new site.
